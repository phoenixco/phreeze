Phreeze 3.0 
===========

Live demo of a Phreeze auto-generated application at http://phreeze.com/cargo/

Phreeze is an ORM and MVC Framework for PHP with an included code generator that creates a clean, functional site based on your existing database schema.

Apps generated with the Phreeze builder provide a RESTful API on the server side.  The client utilizes backbone.js for model and collection binding and bootstrap for a clean layout and user interface.

The user interface generated by Phreeze makes an excellent starting point for an application and reduces the amount of redundant "plumbing" code that must be written.  Phreeze recognizes different data-types and foreign key relationships to create basic viewers and editors that can be used as-is or customized further. 

Code examples and training videos are available at http://phreeze.com/
